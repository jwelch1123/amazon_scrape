##### A web scraping project trying to answer the question: Why are books so needlessly long?

Recent it feels that every book I pick is the same length, about two or three-hundred pages. Once I finish, I consistantly feel that it could have been much shorter with the same or better quality. I want to use this web scraping project to explore whether shorter or longer books do better in the market.
